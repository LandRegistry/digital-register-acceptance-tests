As a user
I want to know about what the service is and does
so that I don't find this out at the end of my journey and waste my time and money

Acceptance Criteria:
 - The fee for the Summary should be displayed to the customer
 - The information of what is contained in the summary should by shown

Scenario:  The correct information is displayed on the landing page
    Given I have gone to the digital register view service
    Then I can confirm the price of the service will be Â£3.00
    And I am provided information on what the service will provide
